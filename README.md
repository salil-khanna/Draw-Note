# Draw Note: Storing Text and Custom Drawings as Notes!
 <p>
                    As per namesake, Draw Note is a Full Stack application developed with Visual Studio and 
                    coded in C# that allows multiple
                    users on their own computers to create notes made of images and text, and save them 
                    to a SQL database via queries! Having barely coded in C# nor SQL prior, I was working 
                    with a blank slate, needing to determine how to transmit information given in by the 
                    user into SQL databases, as well as all possible edge cases that a user could give 
                    to the application. To get a full sense of all the functionality allowed in this 
                    application, <a href="https://youtu.be/oNP--bx7L1k">view this video</a>, otherwise, 
                    a rough description of functionality is as so.

Draw Note allows for the creation of new users, a password forget feature, 
                    the ability to create new notes, save notes, open notes, edit notes, delete notes, 
                    upload images to notes, draw your own images, or even delete a user and all their notes. 
                    C# was used in handling all of the front-end display and inputs, image conversion from images to bytes, 
                    as well as the software that users could draw in. A SQL database was used for data 
                    storage, storing the images as bytes[], as well as saving all of the note text and 
                    user information. The largest challenge was definitely learning how to upload images 
                    to a SQL database!
